# localStorage Removal - Implementation Backlog

## Overview
This backlog contains the complete implementation plan for removing all localStorage usage from the application and replacing it with server-side storage via APIs. All data will be uniquely stored by organization, team, and scavenger hunt to support multi-tenancy and proper data isolation.

## üìÅ Key Documents
- **[000-data-hierarchy-structure.md](000-data-hierarchy-structure.md)** - Explains the hierarchical data structure for multi-tenant storage

## Phases

### Phase 1: Analysis and Preparation ‚è≥
**File:** `001-remove-localstorage-phase1-analysis.md`
- Document all current localStorage usage
- Create migration plan
- Design API endpoints
- Risk assessment

### Phase 2: Replace Zustand Persist ‚è≥
**File:** `002-remove-localstorage-phase2-zustand-store.md`
- Remove persist middleware from app store
- Create server settings service
- Add initialization and sync logic
- Create Netlify functions

### Phase 3: Replace Progress Hook ‚è≥
**File:** `003-remove-localstorage-phase3-progress-hook.md`
- Convert useProgress to server storage
- Install React Query or SWR
- Add optimistic updates
- Remove localStorage code

### Phase 4: Convert DualWriteService ‚è≥
**File:** `004-remove-localstorage-phase4-dualwrite-service.md`
- Create ServerStorageService
- Remove all localStorage operations
- Update all consumers
- Add in-memory cache

### Phase 5: Remove Photo Fallbacks ‚è≥
**File:** `005-remove-localstorage-phase5-photo-upload.md`
- Remove base64 localStorage fallback
- Enforce Cloudinary-only uploads
- Add retry mechanisms
- Update UI components

### Phase 6: Implement API Endpoints ‚è≥
**File:** `006-remove-localstorage-phase6-api-implementation.md`
- Create settings endpoints
- Create progress endpoints
- Add data validation
- Implement rate limiting

### Phase 7: Caching Strategy ‚è≥
**File:** `007-remove-localstorage-phase7-caching-strategy.md`
- Setup React Query
- Implement service-level cache
- Add request deduplication
- Create prefetching strategy

### Phase 8: Migration and Cleanup ‚è≥
**File:** `008-remove-localstorage-phase8-migration.md`
- Create migration script
- Remove old files
- Update imports
- Add feature flags

### Phase 9: Error Handling ‚è≥
**File:** `009-remove-localstorage-phase9-error-handling.md`
- Add error boundaries
- Create offline indicator
- Implement request queue
- Add user feedback

### Phase 10: Testing and Validation ‚è≥
**File:** `010-remove-localstorage-phase10-testing.md`
- Create automated tests
- Performance testing
- Security audit
- Manual testing checklist

## Timeline Estimate
- **Total Duration:** 4-6 weeks
- **Phase 1-2:** Week 1
- **Phase 3-5:** Week 2
- **Phase 6-7:** Week 3
- **Phase 8-9:** Week 4
- **Phase 10:** Week 5
- **Buffer/Fixes:** Week 6

## Key Benefits
‚úÖ **Centralized Data** - All data stored on server
‚úÖ **Cross-Device Sync** - Works across all user devices
‚úÖ **No Storage Limits** - No 5-10MB browser restrictions
‚úÖ **Better Security** - Sensitive data stays on server
‚úÖ **Simpler Architecture** - No dual-write complexity
‚úÖ **Multi-Tenancy** - Proper data isolation by org/team/hunt
‚úÖ **Analytics Ready** - Hierarchical structure enables reporting
‚úÖ **Scalability** - Easy to partition and scale by organization

## Risks & Mitigations
‚ö†Ô∏è **Network Dependency** - App requires internet connection
- Mitigation: Add offline queue and clear messaging

‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Impact** - Network latency for all operations
- Mitigation: Implement aggressive caching strategy

‚ö†Ô∏è **Migration Issues** - Potential data loss during migration
- Mitigation: Backup data, gradual rollout, feature flags

## Success Metrics
- Zero localStorage usage in production
- API response time < 200ms (p95)
- Error rate < 1%
- User satisfaction maintained or improved

## Implementation Order
Phases should be implemented in order as each builds on the previous. Phase 1 (Analysis) is critical and must be completed first. Phases 2-5 can potentially be worked on in parallel by different developers. Phases 6-10 must be sequential.

## Status Legend
- ‚è≥ Not Started
- üöß In Progress
- ‚úÖ Completed
- ‚ùå Blocked
