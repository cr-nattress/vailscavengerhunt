```

### 6. Update Hunt-Specific Progress Elements
**Files:** Hunt progress components, game-specific indicators

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Update hunt-specific progress and status elements that are unique to the scavenger hunt experience.

Hunt progress elements:
- Overall hunt completion percentage
- Individual stop progress tracking
- Clue reveal indicators
- Hint usage tracking
- Time-based progress indicators
- Team progress comparisons (if applicable)

Requirements:
- Maintain gamification aspects with new colors
- Use teal for positive progress
- Ensure progress is motivating and clear
- Consider team/competitive elements
- Keep hunt-specific branding consistent
```

### 7. Update Micro-Interactions and Feedback
**Files:** Micro-interaction components, feedback systems

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Update small progress feedback elements and micro-interactions to enhance the user experience with the new color scheme.

Micro-interactions to update:
- Button click feedback
- Form submission confirmations
- Progress increment animations
- Completion celebration effects
- Hover state progress previews

Guidelines:
- Use subtle teal accents for positive feedback
- Maintain smooth, delightful animations
- Ensure micro-interactions don't interfere with core functionality
- Keep performance impact minimal
- Consider accessibility and motion preferences
```

## Risk Assessment

### Medium Risk Areas
- **Progress Bar Accuracy**: Must reflect actual completion status
  - Mitigation: Thorough testing of progress calculation logic
- **Notification Visibility**: Critical for user awareness
  - Mitigation: High contrast testing, multiple visibility cues
- **Loading State Clarity**: Users need to understand what's happening
  - Mitigation: Clear loading messages, appropriate timing

### Low Risk Areas
- **Micro-interactions**: Enhancement rather than core functionality
- **Progress Animations**: Can be simplified if needed
- **Color-only Indicators**: Can be enhanced with icons/text

## Performance Considerations
- [ ] Progress animations use CSS transforms (GPU-accelerated)
- [ ] Loading states don't cause excessive re-renders
- [ ] Progress updates are debounced appropriately
- [ ] No memory leaks in progress tracking components

## Success Metrics
- [ ] User completion rates remain stable or improve
- [ ] No increase in user confusion about progress status
- [ ] Positive feedback on visual progress clarity
- [ ] Accessibility compliance maintained
- [ ] No performance regressions in progress tracking
