6. **[Task 06: Polish & Validation](./task-06-polish-validation.md)** (2 days)
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Accessibility compliance
   - Performance validation
   - User acceptance testing

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Safe Deployment Approach
- **Feature flags** allow instant rollback
- **CSS custom properties** enable gradual transitions
- **Incremental phases** minimize impact of any single change
- **Component-level rollback** for targeted fixes

### Critical Success Factors
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance maintained
- Core user flows (photo upload, navigation) work flawlessly
- Performance impact < 5% regression
- Cross-browser compatibility > 95%

### Rollback Procedures
1. **Instant**: Toggle feature flags
2. **Quick**: Revert CSS custom properties
3. **Component**: Rollback individual components
4. **Full**: Git revert to previous stable version

## Quality Gates

Each task must pass before proceeding:
- [ ] Functionality preserved
- [ ] Accessibility compliance maintained
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Visual consistency confirmed

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
- Visual regression tests
- Accessibility compliance (axe-core)
- Performance benchmarks
- Cross-browser compatibility

### Manual Testing
- User acceptance testing
- Mobile responsiveness
- Edge case scenarios
- Accessibility user testing

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Zero critical accessibility violations
- Performance within 5% of baseline
- 100% cross-browser compatibility
- Clean, maintainable code

### User Experience Metrics
- Positive user feedback on appearance
- No increase in user-reported issues
- Maintained or improved task completion rates
- Stakeholder approval on final design

## Implementation Notes

### Key Decisions
- Use CSS custom properties for maximum flexibility
- Maintain semantic color meanings (error = red, success = green)
- Preserve all existing functionality during transition
- Focus on accessibility and performance throughout

### Future Considerations
- Theme switching capability (if needed)
- Dark mode implementation potential
- Additional brand color variants
- Seasonal or event-based color modifications

## Documentation Deliverables

### For Developers
- Theme configuration guide
- Color usage guidelines
- Maintenance procedures
- Browser compatibility matrix

### For Stakeholders
- Visual transformation guide
- User impact assessment
- Performance impact report
- Accessibility compliance certificate

## Contact & Escalation

For questions or issues during implementation:
1. **Technical Issues**: Escalate to development team lead
2. **Design Questions**: Consult with UX/UI design team
3. **Accessibility Concerns**: Involve accessibility specialist
4. **Performance Problems**: Engage performance optimization team

## Epic Completion Criteria
