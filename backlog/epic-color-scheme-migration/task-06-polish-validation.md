## Technical Tasks

### 1. Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing
**Browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Mobile browsers

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Conduct comprehensive cross-browser testing for the new color scheme implementation.

Test the following browsers:
- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)
- iOS Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Chrome Mobile (Android, latest version)

Check for:
- CSS custom property support and fallbacks
- Color rendering consistency
- Interactive state behavior
- Transition and animation performance
- Font rendering with new colors
- Shadow and border rendering

Document any browser-specific issues and implement appropriate fixes or fallbacks.
```

### 2. Mobile Responsiveness Validation
**Devices:** Various screen sizes and orientations

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Validate mobile responsiveness across different device categories and screen sizes.

Test on:
- Small phones (320px width, iPhone SE)
- Standard phones (375px width, iPhone 12/13)
- Large phones (414px width, iPhone 12 Pro Max)
- Small tablets (768px width, iPad mini)
- Large tablets (1024px width, iPad Pro)
- Desktop breakpoints (1200px+)

Verify:
- Color contrast remains adequate at all sizes
- Touch targets maintain 44px minimum size
- Text readability at various zoom levels
- Navigation usability on small screens
- Progress indicators remain visible and functional
- Interactive elements respond appropriately to touch
```

### 3. Comprehensive Accessibility Audit
**Standards:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Conduct a thorough accessibility audit of the updated color scheme.

Accessibility checks:
- Color contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Focus indicator visibility and compliance
- Screen reader compatibility with all new colors
- Keyboard navigation functionality
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Color-blind user experience (simulate protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia)
- Reduced motion preferences respect

Tools to use:
- axe-core automated testing
- WAVE browser extension
- Color contrast analyzers
- Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Browser accessibility developer tools

Document all findings and ensure 100% compliance before launch.
```

### 4. Performance Impact Analysis
**Metrics:** Load times, rendering performance, interaction responsiveness

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Analyze the performance impact of the color scheme changes and ensure no regressions.

Performance metrics to measure:
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- CSS recalculation times
- Paint/composite times during interactions

Compare against baseline measurements from before the color changes.

Test scenarios:
- Initial page load performance
- Color transition performance during theme switching
- Interactive element response times
- Progress bar animation smoothness
- Mobile device performance (especially lower-end devices)

Ensure all metrics remain within acceptable ranges (< 5% regression).
```

### 5. Visual Consistency Audit
**Scope:** All application screens and states

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Conduct a comprehensive visual consistency audit across the entire application.

Audit coverage:
- All main application screens/pages
- Modal dialogs and overlays
- Form screens and input states
- Error and success message screens
- Loading and empty states
- Mobile navigation and responsive layouts
- Dark/light theme variations (if applicable)

Check for:
- Consistent use of color variables vs hard-coded colors
- Proper hierarchy and contrast relationships
- Uniform spacing and sizing with new colors
- Consistent interactive state behaviors
- Proper shadow and border applications
- Typography clarity with new color backgrounds

Create a visual consistency checklist and ensure 100% compliance.
```

### 6. User Acceptance Testing Setup
**Participants:** Representative user groups

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Design and conduct user acceptance testing for the new color scheme.

UAT approach:
- Recruit 5-10 representative users
- Create test scenarios covering main user flows
- Focus on usability and visual preference feedback
- Test on both desktop and mobile devices
- Include users with accessibility needs

Test scenarios:
- Complete a typical scavenger hunt flow
- Upload photos and view progress
- Navigate between all main sections
- Use the app in different lighting conditions
- Test with users who have visual impairments

Feedback collection:
- Task completion rates
- User satisfaction scores
- Visual preference ratings
- Accessibility and usability feedback
- Specific pain points or confusion areas

Document all feedback and address critical issues before launch.
```

### 7. Code Cleanup and Optimization
**Focus:** Remove deprecated code, optimize performance

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Perform final code cleanup and optimization for the color scheme implementation.

Cleanup tasks:
- Remove all deprecated color variables (-old suffix)
- Clean up unused CSS rules and properties
- Optimize CSS custom property usage
- Remove any temporary feature flag code
- Consolidate duplicate color definitions
- Optimize CSS bundle size

Code optimization:
- Minify CSS for production
- Ensure efficient CSS selector specificity
- Remove any redundant color declarations
- Optimize transition and animation performance
- Clean up any development/testing code

Documentation:
- Update theme documentation
- Document color variable usage guidelines
- Create maintenance guide for future color changes
- Update style guide with new color specifications
```
