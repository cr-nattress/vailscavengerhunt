# Task 04: Interactive Components & Controls

**Phase:** 4 - Interactive Components
**Risk Level:** Medium-High
**Estimated Effort:** 3 days
**Sprint:** 2

## User Story
**As a user**, I want buttons and interactive elements that are clearly visible and respond appropriately to my actions, so that I can confidently interact with the app.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Upload Photo button updated with new color scheme
- [ ] Form inputs styled consistently with new theme
- [ ] Bottom navigation colors updated and functional
- [ ] Hover states properly defined and smooth
- [ ] Active/focus states maintained and accessible
- [ ] Touch targets remain accessible (44px minimum)
- [ ] Loading states visually consistent with new theme
- [ ] Disabled states clearly indicated
- [ ] All interactive feedback preserved

## Technical Tasks

### 1. Update Primary Action Buttons
**Files:** Button components, Upload Photo button

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Update the "Upload Photo" button and other primary action buttons to use the new color scheme.

Primary buttons should:
- Use teal (#14B8A6) as background color with white text
- Maintain proper contrast ratio (minimum 4.5:1)
- Have smooth hover/focus transitions
- Use appropriate shadow effects with var(--shadow-md)
- Work well on both light and dark backgrounds

Look for:
- Upload Photo button styling
- Submit buttons in forms
- Primary action buttons throughout the app
- Call-to-action buttons

Ensure accessibility and visual prominence are maintained.
```

### 2. Update Form Input Elements
**Files:** Form components, input components

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Update form inputs to align with the new Modern Tech color scheme.

Form elements to update:
- Text inputs and textareas
- Select dropdowns
- Checkboxes and radio buttons
- Input labels and placeholders
- Form field borders and focus states

Styling guidelines:
- Use var(--color-border) for default borders
- Use var(--color-accent) for focus states
- Placeholder text should use var(--color-text-secondary)
- Error states should use var(--color-error)
- Success states should use var(--color-success)
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy
```

### 3. Update Bottom Navigation
**Files:** Bottom navigation component

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Update the bottom navigation bar to use white background (#FFFFFF) and new color scheme.

Elements to update:
- Navigation bar background color
- Navigation icon colors (inactive state)
- Active navigation item highlighting
- Navigation text colors
- Any badges or indicators on navigation items

Ensure:
- Icons are clearly visible against white background
- Active state uses teal accent color
- Proper contrast for all text and icons
- Touch targets remain appropriately sized
- Visual hierarchy between active and inactive items
```

### 4. Implement Comprehensive Hover States
**Files:** All interactive components

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Create comprehensive hover states for all interactive elements using the new color palette.

Interactive elements to update:
- Buttons (primary, secondary, text buttons)
- Navigation links
- Cards that are clickable
- Icon buttons
- List items that are selectable

Hover effects should:
- Use subtle color variations (10-20% darker/lighter)
- Include smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Provide clear feedback without being distracting
- Work well on both light and dark backgrounds
- Be consistent across similar element types
```

### 5. Update Focus and Active States
**Files:** All interactive components

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Update focus and active states for keyboard navigation and accessibility.

Focus states should:
- Use teal accent color for focus outlines
- Be clearly visible against all backgrounds
- Meet WCAG 2.1 focus indicator requirements
- Not interfere with the overall design aesthetic

Active states should:
- Provide immediate feedback when pressed/clicked
- Use appropriate color variations or transforms
- Work well with hover states (non-conflicting)
- Be consistent across component types

Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
```

### 6. Update Loading and Disabled States
**Files:** Loading components, disabled state utilities

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Update loading indicators and disabled states to use the new color scheme.

Loading states:
- Spinner colors should use teal accent
- Progress indicators should be consistent with theme
- Loading text should use secondary text color
- Skeleton loading states should use subtle grays

Disabled states:
- Use muted versions of theme colors
- Ensure disabled elements are clearly non-interactive
- Maintain accessibility standards for disabled content
- Use opacity or color variations to indicate disabled state
```

### 7. Update Secondary and Text Buttons
**Files:** Button variant components

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Update secondary buttons and text-only buttons to complement primary buttons.

Secondary buttons should:
- Use white/transparent background with teal border
- Use teal text color
- Have appropriate hover states (light teal background)
- Maintain proper spacing and typography

Text buttons should:
- Use teal color for text
- Have subtle hover effects
- Maintain good contrast ratios
- Be clearly clickable but not overwhelming

Ensure visual hierarchy between primary, secondary, and text buttons.
```

## Component Priority Matrix

### Critical (Must Work Perfectly)
1. **Upload Photo Button** - Core user action
2. **Form Inputs** - Essential for data entry
3. **Bottom Navigation** - Primary app navigation
4. **Primary Action Buttons** - Key user flows

### High Priority
1. **Hover States** - User feedback and polish
2. **Focus States** - Accessibility compliance
3. **Loading States** - User experience during operations
4. **Secondary Buttons** - Supporting actions

### Medium Priority
1. **Disabled States** - Edge case handling
2. **Text Buttons** - Minor interactions
3. **Active States** - Micro-interactions
4. **Icon Buttons** - Utility interactions

## Testing Requirements

### Functional Testing
- [ ] All buttons perform their intended actions
- [ ] Form submissions work correctly
- [ ] Navigation functions properly
- [ ] Loading states appear and disappear correctly
- [ ] Disabled elements cannot be interacted with

### Interaction Testing
- [ ] Hover effects are smooth and appropriate
- [ ] Focus states are clearly visible

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Areas
- **Photo Upload Button**: Critical to core user flow
  - Mitigation: Extra testing, gradual rollout
- **Form Interactions**: Essential for data entry
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive form testing across devices
- **Navigation**: Core app functionality
  - Mitigation: Maintain navigation patterns, test extensively

### Medium Risk Areas
- **Hover Effects**: Could impact user experience
  - Mitigation: Subtle, consistent effects across components
- **Focus States**: Accessibility compliance requirement
  - Mitigation: Follow WCAG guidelines, test with keyboard users

## Performance Considerations
- [ ] CSS transitions don't cause layout thrashing
- [ ] Hover effects are GPU-accelerated where appropriate
- [ ] No significant impact on interaction response times
- [ ] Loading states don't block user interactions unnecessarily

## Browser Compatibility
- [ ] All interactive states work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] Mobile browsers handle touch interactions correctly
- [ ] CSS transitions are supported or gracefully degrade
- [ ] Focus indicators work consistently across browsers

## Rollback Plan
1. **Component-Level Rollback**: Revert individual interactive components
2. **State-Specific Rollback**: Rollback only problematic interaction states
3. **Feature Flag Rollback**: Disable interactive component updates
4. **CSS-Only Rollback**: Revert CSS changes while keeping functionality

## Success Metrics
- [ ] No increase in user-reported interaction issues
- [ ] Accessibility score maintained or improved
- [ ] User task completion rates remain stable
- [ ] Positive feedback on visual improvements
- [ ] No performance regressions in interaction response times

## Dependencies
- Task 03: Navigation & Header (should be complete)
- Accessibility testing tools configured
- Cross-browser testing environment ready

## Follow-up Tasks
- Task 05: Progress & Status Indicators
- User feedback collection on interaction improvements
- Performance monitoring for interactive elements
- A/B testing setup for button effectiveness (if applicable)
