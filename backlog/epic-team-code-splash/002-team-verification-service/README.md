# User Story 002: Team Verification Service

**As a system**, I want to verify team codes and issue lock tokens **so that** valid team members can be authenticated while preventing unauthorized access.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Netlify Function handles team code verification requests
- [ ] Server validates team codes against Table Storage mappings
- [ ] Lock tokens issued with 24-hour TTL and team binding
- [ ] Device conflict detection prevents multi-team participation
- [ ] Rate limiting protects against brute force attacks

## Tasks
1. `task-01-team-verify-function.md` - Create team verification Netlify Function
2. `task-02-conflict-detection.md` - Implement device conflict detection
3. `task-03-rate-limiting.md` - Add rate limiting and security measures
4. `task-04-team-current-endpoint.md` - Create team context retrieval endpoint

## Definition of Done
- Team verification endpoint handles all error cases properly
- Device fingerprinting prevents multi-team exploitation
- Rate limiting implemented with appropriate thresholds
- All security measures tested and validated
- No impact on existing API endpoints
