# User Story 001: Foundation Infrastructure

**As a developer**, I want to establish the foundational infrastructure for team lock storage and validation **so that** subsequent features can build incrementally without breaking existing functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Table storage schema defined for team code mappings
- [ ] Blob storage structure established for team data
- [ ] Base storage utilities created following existing patterns
- [ ] Lock token generation/validation utilities implemented
- [ ] Zero impact on existing application functionality

## Tasks
1. `task-01-storage-schemas.md` - Define storage schemas and validation
2. `task-02-lock-utilities.md` - Create lock token generation/validation
3. `task-03-storage-helpers.md` - Build storage utility functions
4. `task-04-error-codes.md` - Define standardized error codes

## Definition of Done
- All storage schemas documented with TypeScript interfaces
- Lock utilities tested with unit tests
- Storage helpers follow existing service patterns
- Error codes align with current API conventions
- No changes to existing UI or user flows
