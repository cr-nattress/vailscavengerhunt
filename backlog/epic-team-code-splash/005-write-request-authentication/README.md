# User Story 005: Write Request Authentication

**As a system**, I want to validate team locks on all write operations **so that** only authorized team members can modify team data.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All write endpoints validate X-Team-Lock header
- [ ] Lock token verification with team ID extraction
- [ ] Team mismatch validation for data access
- [ ] Graceful handling of expired/invalid tokens
- [ ] Existing write operations continue working for non-team users

## Tasks
1. `task-01-middleware-pattern.md` - Create team lock validation middleware
2. `task-02-header-injection.md` - Add header injection to client requests
3. `task-03-endpoint-protection.md` - Protect existing write endpoints
4. `task-04-error-handling.md` - Implement comprehensive error responses

## Definition of Done
- All write endpoints protected with team lock validation
- Client automatically includes lock tokens in requests
- Error handling provides clear feedback and appropriate redirects
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing functionality
- Performance impact minimized through efficient validation
