# User Story 008: Integration & Testing

**As a developer**, I want comprehensive testing of the team lock system **so that** we can ensure reliability and security before deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all team lock utilities and services
- [ ] Integration tests for complete team verification flow
- [ ] End-to-end tests covering user scenarios
- [ ] Security testing for token validation and edge cases
- [ ] Performance testing for lock validation overhead

## Tasks
1. `task-01-unit-tests.md` - Create unit tests for core utilities
2. `task-02-integration-tests.md` - Test complete verification flows
3. `task-03-security-tests.md` - Validate security measures and edge cases
4. `task-04-e2e-tests.md` - Create end-to-end user scenario tests

## Definition of Done
- All core utilities have comprehensive unit tests
- Integration tests cover happy path and error scenarios
- Security vulnerabilities identified and addressed
- E2E tests validate complete user flows
- Test coverage meets project standards
