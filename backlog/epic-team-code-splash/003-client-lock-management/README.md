# User Story 003: Client Lock Management

**As a client application**, I want to manage team lock state in localStorage **so that** returning users can skip re-authentication within the 24-hour window.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Team lock stored securely in localStorage with TTL validation
- [ ] Lock expiration checked on app initialization
- [ ] Invalid or expired locks automatically cleared
- [ ] Lock state integration with existing app initialization flow
- [ ] No disruption to users without team locks (existing behavior)

## Tasks
1. `task-01-lock-service-integration.md` - Integrate TeamLockService with app initialization
2. `task-02-app-store-integration.md` - Add team context to existing app store
3. `task-03-initialization-flow.md` - Update app startup to check team locks
4. `task-04-lock-restoration.md` - Handle lock restoration and validation

## Definition of Done
- Team locks managed automatically on app startup
- Expired locks cleared without user intervention
- Team context available throughout application
- Existing users experience no changes
- Lock restoration works reliably across browser sessions
