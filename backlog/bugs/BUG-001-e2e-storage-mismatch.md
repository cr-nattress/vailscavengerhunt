# BUG-001: E2E Test Failures Due to Storage Architecture Mismatch

## 🐛 Bug Summary
End-to-end tests are failing with authentication and storage errors because the application has a mixed storage architecture where team codes have been migrated to Supabase but Netlify Functions still attempt to access them from blob storage.

## 📊 Test Results
- **12 out of 34 E2E tests failing** (35% failure rate)
- **All Supabase tests passing** (16/16) - Migration successful
- **Netlify Functions partially working** (6/18) - Storage backend issues

## 🔍 Error Analysis
The E2E test suite reveals critical errors in the following areas:

### Team Verification Errors
```
❌ POST /team-verify should validate team codes
   Expected: 200, Received: 401
   Error: "That code didn't work. Check with your host."
   Code: "TEAM_CODE_INVALID"
```

### Storage Backend Errors
```
❌ Health Check shows degraded status:
   "blobs": { "kv": false, "huntData": false }
   "checks": { "blobStoresAccessible": false }
```

### Function Access Errors
```
❌ KV Operations: 404 errors - Functions not accessible
❌ Settings Management: 500 errors - Storage backend failure
❌ Progress Management: 400/500 errors - Storage mismatch
```

## 🎯 Root Cause
**Storage Architecture Gap**: The data migration successfully moved team codes and hunt data to Supabase, but the Netlify Functions still attempt to access this data from the legacy blob storage system.

**Evidence:**
1. Team code `ALPHA01` exists in Supabase (confirmed by successful Supabase tests)
2. Team verification function returns `TEAM_CODE_INVALID` (looking in blob storage)
3. Health check shows blob storage inaccessible in dev environment

## 💥 Impact
- **High**: Team authentication completely broken
- **Medium**: Progress tracking not working
- **Medium**: Settings and leaderboard functionality failing
- **Low**: Core hunt system works (Supabase functions operational)

## 🔧 Expected Behavior
- Team verification should succeed with valid codes like `ALPHA01`
- Progress updates should persist to Supabase
- All API endpoints should return appropriate responses
- E2E test success rate should be >90%

## 📋 Reproduction Steps
1. Run `npm run test:e2e`
2. Observe team verification failures with valid team codes
3. Check health endpoint shows degraded blob storage status
4. Verify Supabase tests all pass (data is available)

## 🧪 Test Evidence
```bash
# This succeeds (Supabase)
✅ Team codes should be configured: ALPHA01 found in team_codes table

# This fails (Netlify Function)
❌ POST /team-verify with ALPHA01: 401 TEAM_CODE_INVALID
```

## 📁 Affected Files
- `netlify/functions/team-verify.js` - Still uses blob storage lookup
- `netlify/functions/_lib/teamStorage.js` - Legacy storage implementation
- `netlify/functions/progress-*.js` - Progress tracking functions
- `netlify/functions/kv-*.js` - Key-value storage functions

## 🚀 TASK: Analyze and Fix E2E Test Storage Errors

### Objective
Analyze the E2E test failures and implement fixes to bridge the storage architecture gap between Supabase (new) and blob storage (legacy).

### Prompt for Implementation

**Phase 1: Error Analysis**
```
Analyze the E2E test failures in detail:

1. Examine the team-verify function to understand why it returns 401 for valid team codes
2. Investigate the storage backend configuration and blob storage accessibility
3. Identify all functions that still depend on blob storage vs Supabase
4. Document the exact error patterns and their root causes

Focus on:
- Team verification logic flow
- Storage system interactions
- Environment configuration issues
- Function routing and accessibility
```

**Phase 2: Storage Bridge Implementation**
```
Create a bridging solution that allows Netlify Functions to work with Supabase data:

1. Update team-verify function to check Supabase team_codes table instead of blob storage
2. Migrate progress tracking from blob storage to Supabase hunt_progress table
3. Update or create adapter functions to bridge storage systems
4. Ensure backward compatibility during transition

Requirements:
- Team codes ALPHA01-JULIET10 should authenticate successfully
- Progress updates should persist to Supabase
- Maintain existing API contracts and response formats
- Handle both local dev and production environments
```

**Phase 3: Integration Testing**
```
Verify the fixes resolve the E2E test failures:

1. Run the E2E test suite and confirm >90% pass rate
2. Test team authentication with known valid codes
3. Verify progress tracking persistence
4. Validate all API endpoints return correct responses
5. Ensure Supabase integration remains fully functional

Success criteria:
- Team verification succeeds with ALPHA01-JULIET10
- Progress updates visible in Supabase hunt_progress table
- E2E test suite shows <10% failure rate
- Health check reports healthy status
```

### Implementation Notes
- **Priority**: High - Blocking team authentication
- **Complexity**: Medium - Storage system integration
- **Risk**: Low - Supabase data is intact and accessible
- **Testing**: E2E test suite provides comprehensive validation

### Technical Context
- Team codes successfully migrated to Supabase `team_codes` table
- Hunt data available in Supabase `hunt_progress` table
- Functions expect blob storage format but data is in relational format
- Local dev environment may not have blob storage configured
- All Supabase connectivity and queries working correctly

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Team verification works with codes ALPHA01-JULIET10
- [ ] Progress tracking persists to Supabase
- [ ] E2E test suite passes >30 of 34 tests
- [ ] Health endpoint shows healthy or acceptable status
- [ ] No regression in Supabase functionality

### Definition of Done
- All E2E test failures analyzed and documented
- Storage bridge implemented and tested
- Team authentication fully functional
- Progress tracking integrated with Supabase
- E2E test suite validates the fixes
