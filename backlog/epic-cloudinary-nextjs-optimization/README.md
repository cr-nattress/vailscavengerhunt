# Epic: Cloudinary + Next.js + Netlify Image Optimization

## Overview
Implement comprehensive image optimization using Cloudinary's transformation parameters, Next.js Image component integration, and Netlify Functions to reduce bandwidth by 60-90% while maintaining excellent visual quality. This epic builds upon the frontend URL optimization work and extends it with Next.js best practices and Netlify function integration.

## Problem Statement
The application currently delivers images without comprehensive optimization:
- Images served at original sizes (up to 4 MB per image)
- No automatic format selection (AVIF/WebP)
- No device pixel ratio optimization for Retina displays
- No consistent transformation strategy across the app
- No Next.js Image component integration
- Limited caching strategy

This results in:
- Slow load times, especially on mobile (15-30 seconds)
- High bandwidth costs for users and infrastructure
- Poor Core Web Vitals scores
- Suboptimal user experience on slow connections

## Solution
Implement a multi-layered optimization strategy:

1. **Cloudinary Transformation Best Practices**
   - Apply `f_auto` (automatic format selection)
   - Apply `q_auto:good` (intelligent quality optimization)
   - Apply context-appropriate sizing (400px, 800px, 1200px, 1600px)
   - Add `dpr_auto` for Retina display support
   - Include `fl_progressive` for better perceived performance

2. **Next.js Image Component Integration**
   - Custom Cloudinary loader for `next/image`
   - Automatic srcSet generation for responsive images
   - Built-in lazy loading
   - Global configuration in `next.config.js`

3. **Netlify Function Enhancement**
   - Image proxy function with optimization
   - Signed URL generator for private images
   - Batch optimization endpoint
   - Edge function for automatic transformation

4. **Global Middleware & Context**
   - React context for consistent Cloudinary configuration
   - Global transformation defaults
   - Performance monitoring utilities

## Current State
- **Frontend**: React components displaying Cloudinary images via direct URLs
- **Optimization**: Basic `optimizeCloudinaryUrl()` utility exists (from epic-cloudinary-optimization)
- **Next.js**: Not yet integrated
- **Netlify Functions**: Exist for photo upload but no optimization proxies
- **Average image size**: 2-4 MB
- **Load times**: 15-30 seconds on 4G

## Goals
- **60-90% bandwidth reduction** across all image types
- **5-10x faster load times** on mobile devices
- **Retina display support** with automatic DPR
- **Modern format delivery** (AVIF/WebP with JPEG fallback)
- **Next.js integration** with custom Cloudinary loader
- **Netlify function proxies** for consistent optimization
- **Global configuration** for easy maintenance
- **Performance monitoring** to validate improvements

## Notes
- This epic builds upon `epic-cloudinary-optimization` (frontend URL transformation)
- Requires Next.js migration or coexistence with React components
- Netlify Functions are optional but recommended for consistency
- Edge Functions provide best performance but require Netlify Pro plan
- All existing images will work with optimizations (no re-upload needed)
- Cloudinary transformations are cached by CDN after first generation
- Original high-resolution images remain untouched in Cloudinary storage
