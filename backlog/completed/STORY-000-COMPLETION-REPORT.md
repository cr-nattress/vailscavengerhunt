## Story: Supabase Infrastructure Setup
**Completed:** September 25, 2025
**Duration:** ~1 hour

---

## ✅ All Acceptance Criteria Met

### 1. Supabase Project Setup
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- Credentials already existed in `.env`
- Connection verified and working

### 2. Database Schema Execution
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- All 6 tables created successfully:
  - ✅ `device_locks`
  - ✅ `debug_logs`
  - ✅ `kv_store`
  - ✅ `team_progress`
  - ✅ `team_mappings`
  - ✅ `hunt_settings`
- Indexes and triggers created
- RLS policies applied

### 3. Environment Configuration
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- Variables configured in:
  - `.env` (local development)
  - `netlify.toml` (redirects)
  - Netlify functions (via dotenv)

### 4. Supabase Client Utility

  - Helper methods (upsert, bulkInsert, etc.)
  - Error handling without exposing sensitive data

### 5. Connection Testing
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- Local test script: `scripts/test-supabase-connection.js`
- Netlify function: `netlify/functions/test-supabase.js`
- Both tests passing with full CRUD operations

2. `scripts/test-supabase-connection.js` - Connection test script
3. `netlify/functions/test-supabase.js` - Netlify function test
4. `scripts/sql/supabase-migration-schema-safe.sql` - Full safe schema
5. `scripts/sql/supabase-tables-only.sql` - Simplified schema (used)
6. `backlog/completed/STORY-000-COMPLETION-REPORT.md` - This report

### Modified Files
1. `netlify.toml` - Added test endpoint redirect
2. `netlify/functions/package.json` - Added @supabase/supabase-js and dotenv

## Test Results

### Local Connection Test
```
✓ Connection: Working
✓ Tables Existing: 6/6
✓ All systems operational!
✓ CRUD operations successful on all tables
```

### Netlify Function Test
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Supabase connection successful",
  "summary": {
    "total": 6,
    "existing": 6,
    "missing": 0
  }
}
```

## Packages Installed

### Main Project
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Supabase JavaScript client
- `dotenv` - Environment variable loader

### Netlify Functions
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Supabase JavaScript client
- `dotenv` - Environment variable loader

## Next Steps

With STORY-000 complete, the following stories are now unblocked:

### High Priority (Start These)
1. **STORY-001:** Migrate Debug Logging System
2. **STORY-002:** Migrate Health Check

### Medium Priority (After Above)
3. **STORY-003:** Migrate KV Store Operations
4. **STORY-004:** Migrate Settings Management

### Critical Path (Week 3-4)
5. **STORY-005:** Migrate Team Storage and Mappings
6. **STORY-006:** Migrate Leaderboard Function

## Lessons Learned

1. **Schema Complexity:** The pg_cron scheduling was too complex for initial setup. The simplified schema worked better.
2. **Environment Variables:** Needed to add dotenv to Netlify functions for local development.
3. **Connection Testing:** Auth check works better than table queries for initial connection verification.
4. **ESM vs CommonJS:** Project uses ESM modules, needed to adapt test scripts accordingly.

## Risk Assessment

- ✅ **No risks identified** - Infrastructure is stable and ready for migration
- All connections working
- No security issues (service role key properly secured)
- Tables created with proper indexes for performance

---

## Recommendation

**Proceed with Phase 1 migrations (STORY-001 and STORY-002)** as they are:
- Low risk
- Good test cases
- Independent of other systems

Start both in parallel as they don't conflict with each other.
