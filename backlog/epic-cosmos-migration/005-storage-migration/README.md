# User Story 005: Storage Migration (Optional)

## Description
As a developer, I want to evaluate migrating from Cloudinary to Supabase Storage so that I can potentially save $89/month and consolidate services while maintaining photo upload functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Supabase Storage evaluated for photo upload requirements
- [ ] Cost-benefit analysis completed for storage migration
- [ ] Photo upload functionality implemented with Supabase Storage
- [ ] Image transformation and CDN capabilities assessed
- [ ] Migration strategy developed for existing photos
- [ ] Fallback strategy maintained for rollback capability

## Tasks
1. **Storage Evaluation** - Assess Supabase Storage capabilities vs Cloudinary
2. **Cost Analysis** - Calculate potential savings and feature trade-offs
3. **Upload Implementation** - Implement photo upload with Supabase Storage
4. **Image Processing** - Evaluate and implement image transformation needs
5. **Migration Strategy** - Plan migration of existing photos if beneficial

## Dependencies
- User Story 001-008 completed and stable
- Current Cloudinary usage analysis
- Photo upload requirements assessment

## Definition of Done
- Comprehensive evaluation completed
- Cost-benefit analysis documented
- Working photo upload implementation (if proceeding)
- Migration plan created (if beneficial)
- Recommendation made on whether to migrate
- Implementation ready for production (if approved)

## Notes
This is an optional story to be evaluated after core migration is complete. The potential $89/month savings make it worth investigating, but should not delay the primary Supabase migration.
