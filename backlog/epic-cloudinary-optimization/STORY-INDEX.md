## Stories

### âœ… Phase 1: Core Implementation

#### [STORY-001: Create Cloudinary URL Optimization Utility](./STORY-001-utility-function.md)
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Not Started
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: None
**Priority**: CRITICAL (blocks all other stories)

**Summary**: Create the core utility function that transforms Cloudinary URLs with optimization parameters.

**Key Deliverables**:

- Verify expand/collapse functionality

**Expected Results**:
- Collage size: 4 MB â†’ 1.5 MB (62% reduction)
- Load time on 4G: 6-8s â†’ 2-3s (3x faster)

---

#### [STORY-005: Apply Optimization to UpdatesView](./STORY-005-updatesview-optimization.md)
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Not Started
**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour (includes analysis)
**Dependencies**: STORY-001
**Priority**: LOW (may not display photos)

**Summary**: Analyze UpdatesView for photo displays and apply optimization if photos are present.

**Key Tasks**:
- Analyze UpdatesView to determine if photos are displayed
- If yes: Apply appropriate optimization
- If no: Document and close story

**Note**: Exploratory story - may result in "No changes required"

---

### âœ… Phase 3: Testing & Documentation

#### [STORY-006: Comprehensive Testing and Documentation](./STORY-006-testing-and-docs.md)
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Not Started
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: Stories 001-005 completed
**Priority**: CRITICAL (validation and maintainability)

**Summary**: Create comprehensive tests, performance benchmarks, and documentation for the optimization feature.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Complete unit test suite (100% coverage)
- Performance benchmark results
- Usage guidelines document
- Updated epic documentation
- Code review preparation

## Implementation Order

### Recommended Sequence:
1. **STORY-001** - Create utility function (MUST be first)
2. **STORY-002** - HistoryView (highest impact)
3. **STORY-003** - ActiveView (user feedback)
4. **STORY-004** - AlbumViewer (showcase)
5. **STORY-005** - UpdatesView (exploratory)
6. **STORY-006** - Testing & Documentation (final validation)

### Alternative Parallel Approach:
After completing STORY-001, stories 002-005 can be worked on in parallel by different developers, as they are independent of each other.

cat STORY-001-utility-function.md

# 2. Follow Task 1 prompt to create type definitions
# 3. Follow Task 2 prompt to create utility function
# 4. Follow Task 3 prompt to create unit tests

# View epic overview
cat README.md

# Check specific story
cat STORY-00X-story-name.md
```

## Notes

### Why This Approach?
- âœ… **Frontend-only**: No backend changes, no database migrations
- âœ… **Non-breaking**: Works with all existing images
- âœ… **Reversible**: Easy to rollback if needed
- âœ… **Incremental**: Can deploy view-by-view
- âœ… **High impact**: 80-90% bandwidth reduction
- âœ… **Fast implementation**: 8-12 hours total

### Key Technical Decisions
- **URL Transformation**: Modify URLs at render time (not in database)
- **Context-based**: Different optimization levels for different use cases
- **Cloudinary CDN**: Leverages existing infrastructure
- **Pure Functions**: Utility is stateless and idempotent
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and IntelliSense support

### Risks Mitigated
- âœ… Visual quality: Conservative quality settings (auto:good)
- âœ… Compatibility: Automatic format fallback to JPEG
- âœ… Breaking changes: Additive transformation (original URLs still work)
- âœ… Performance: Cloudinary CDN caches transformations
- âœ… Testing: Comprehensive test suite in STORY-006
