# Hunt Progress Update Investigation - Findings Report

## Date: 2025-09-27

## Executive Summary
The hunt_progress table in Supabase **IS being updated successfully** after our UUID fix. However, the updates are not visible in the application because the app is using a local in-memory store instead of reading from the Supabase database.

## Key Findings

### 1. ✅ Database Updates Are Working
After fixing the UUID type mismatch, the hunt_progress table is successfully being updated:
```
[req_1759005621465_xsk32i99f] Found team UUID: 7d693649-5441-458d-9bb9-50c76455703e for team name: teacup
[req_1759005621465_xsk32i99f] Hunt progress upserted: {
  teamId: '7d693649-5441-458d-9bb9-50c76455703e',
  originalTeamId: 'teacup',
  locationId: 'stop_1',
  operation: 'updated'
}
```

Multiple successful uploads confirmed:
- stop_1 (Covered Bridge) - Updated
- stop_3 (The Gore Range) - Updated
- stop_6 (Skier) - Updated

### 2. ❌ App Not Reading from Supabase
The application has **two different progress storage systems**:

#### A. Photo Upload Path (Working ✅)
- `photo-upload-orchestrated.js` → Updates Supabase hunt_progress table
- Uses proper team UUID lookup
- Successfully writes to database

#### B. App Display Path (Not Using Supabase ❌)
- `ProgressService.ts` → Calls `/api/progress/${orgId}/${teamId}/${huntId}`
- `progressRoute.ts` → Uses `localProgressStore` (in-memory)
- Never reads from Supabase hunt_progress table

### 3. Root Cause
The application has a **disconnected architecture**:
- Photo uploads write directly to Supabase
- UI reads from local in-memory store
- No synchronization between the two systems

## Evidence

### Server Logs Show Successful Updates:
```
[req_1759005702590_t5cs272k8] Looking up team UUID for team name: teacup
[req_1759005702590_t5cs272k8] Found team UUID: 7d693649-5441-458d-9bb9-50c76455703e
[req_1759005702590_t5cs272k8] Hunt progress upserted
[req_1759005702590_t5cs272k8] Orchestrated upload completed successfully
```

### Progress Route Uses Local Store:
```typescript
// progressRoute.ts line 34
const progress = localProgressStore.get(key) || {}
```

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Update Progress Route to Use Supabase
Modify `progressRoute.ts` to read from Supabase hunt_progress table instead of localProgressStore.

### Option 2: Sync After Photo Upload
After successful photo upload, update the localProgressStore with the new progress.

### Option 3: Use Consolidated Endpoint
The app may have a consolidated endpoint that properly reads from Supabase. Check if `/api/consolidated/active` includes progress data.

## Files Involved

### Working (Database Updates):
- `/netlify/functions/photo-upload-orchestrated.js` - Writes to Supabase ✅
- Team UUID lookup logic - Working correctly ✅

### Not Connected to Database:
- `/src/server/progressRoute.ts` - Uses localProgressStore ❌
- `/src/services/ProgressService.ts` - Calls progress API ❌

### Potential Solution Files:
- `/netlify/functions/progress-get-supabase.js` - Exists but not used
- `/src/server/consolidatedRoute.ts` - May have integrated progress

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Fix**: Update `progressRoute.ts` to call `progress-get-supabase` function
2. **Long-term**: Consolidate all progress operations to use single source of truth (Supabase)
3. **Testing**: Verify progress updates are visible in UI after fix

## Conclusion

The database is working correctly. The issue is an architectural disconnect where:
- Photo uploads → Write to Supabase ✅
- UI display → Read from local memory ❌

The fix requires connecting the read path to Supabase, matching the write path.
