# Sentry Integration - Always Enabled Configuration

## Overview
Sentry error tracking and logging is now **always enabled** in this application. It no longer requires configuration toggles or environment variables to activate.

## What Changed

### Before (Conditional)
- Required `VITE_ENABLE_SENTRY=true` to activate
- Required `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` to be set
- Could be disabled in development

### After (Always Enabled)
- Sentry initializes automatically on application start
- Uses environment DSN if available, otherwise uses placeholder
- Cannot be disabled via configuration
- All loggers automatically include Sentry sink

## Configuration

### Optional Environment Variables
While Sentry is always enabled, you can still customize its behavior:

```bash
# Custom DSN (recommended for production)
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://your_key@o123456.ingest.sentry.io/1234567

# Environment name
VITE_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production

# Release version
VITE_SENTRY_RELEASE=1.0.0

# Traces sample rate (0.0 to 1.0)
VITE_SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1
```

### Files Modified

1. **`src/logging/initSentryClient.ts`**
   - Removed conditional checks
   - Always initializes with DSN (uses placeholder if not set)

2. **`src/logging/initSentryNode.ts`**
   - Removed DSN requirement check
   - Always initializes for Node.js

3. **`src/logging/factories/clientLoggerFactory.ts`**
   - `enableSentry: true` hardcoded for all loggers
   - Removed environment variable checks

4. **`src/logging/factories/serverLoggerFactory.ts`**
   - `enableSentry: true` by default
   - All server loggers use Sentry

5. **`src/logging/adapters/legacyLogger.ts`**
   - Removed conditional Sentry checks
   - Always passes `enableSentry: true`

## Testing

To verify Sentry is working:

1. **Check Console**
   ```
   [Sentry] Browser client initialized successfully
   ```

2. **Use Test Component**
   ```jsx
   import { SentryTestComponent } from './components/SentryTestComponent'

   // Add to your app temporarily
   <SentryTestComponent />
   ```

3. **Trigger Test Error**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   throw new Error("Test Sentry Integration")
   ```

## Production Deployment

### Important: Set Real DSN for Production
While Sentry will work with the placeholder DSN, you should set a real DSN for production:

1. **Get DSN from Sentry**
   - Go to https://sentry.io
   - Navigate to Settings → Projects → [Your Project] → Client Keys
   - Copy the DSN

2. **Set in Environment**
   ```bash
   # .env.production
   VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://your_actual_key@o123456.ingest.sentry.io/1234567
   VITE_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production
   ```

3. **Deploy Environment Variables**
   - **Vercel**: Add in project settings
   - **Netlify**: Add in site settings
   - **Docker**: Include in container environment

## Benefits

1. **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box
2. **No Missing Errors**: Can't accidentally disable in production
3. **Consistent Logging**: All environments use same logging pipeline
4. **Easier Development**: No need to toggle flags during development

## Monitoring

All logs automatically flow to Sentry:
- **Errors**: Captured as exceptions
- **Warnings/Info**: Added as breadcrumbs
- **Debug**: Added as breadcrumbs (in debug mode)

## Privacy

PII redaction is still active and automatic:
- Email addresses are masked
- Phone numbers are masked
- Credit card numbers are masked
- Social security numbers are masked
- Custom patterns can be added in `src/logging/piiRedaction.ts`
