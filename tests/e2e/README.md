# End-to-End API Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive end-to-end tests for the Vail Scavenger Hunt application, covering both Netlify Functions and Supabase integration.

## Test Files

### `netlify-functions.test.js`
Tests all Netlify Function endpoints to verify:
- ✅ Health checks and system status
- ❌ Team verification and authentication (needs blob storage)
- ✅ CORS headers and error handling
- ❌ Progress management (needs blob storage)
- ❌ KV operations (needs blob storage)
- ❌ Settings management (needs blob storage)
- ❌ Leaderboard functionality (needs blob storage)

### `supabase-integration.test.js`
Tests the new Supabase-based hunt system:
- ✅ Database schema validation (16/16 tests passing)
- ✅ Hunt configuration system
- ✅ Data migration verification
- ✅ RPC function testing
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ Data integrity checks
- ✅ Performance validation

### `setup.js`
Global test configuration and utilities:
- Service readiness checks
- Environment validation
- Test helpers and utilities

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests in watch mode
npm run test:e2e:watch

# Run all tests (unit + E2E)
npm run test:all
```

## Test Results Summary

**Current Status: 22/34 tests passing (65%)**

### ✅ Working (22 tests)
- **Supabase Integration**: All 16 tests passing
  - Database schema validation
  - Hunt configuration system
  - Data migration verification
  - RPC functions (get_hunt_stops, initialize_team_for_hunt)
  - Progress tracking and leaderboard
  - Data integrity and performance

- **Netlify Functions**: 6/18 tests passing
  - Health endpoint structure
  - CORS handling
  - Error responses (404, 405)
  - Basic authentication rejection

### ❌ Failing (12 tests)
- **Team Verification**: Authentication system needs blob storage connection
- **Progress Management**: Functions require Netlify Blobs access
- **KV Operations**: Blob storage not accessible in dev environment
- **Settings Management**: Depends on blob storage
- **Leaderboard**: Needs proper storage backend

## Key Findings

### 1. Supabase Migration Success ✅
- All database tables properly created and populated
- Hunt configuration system working correctly
- Team data migrated successfully (10 BHHS teams with codes ALPHA01-JULIET10)
- RPC functions performing well (sub-200ms response times)

### 2. Storage Architecture Gap ❌
The application has a **dual storage system**:
- **Legacy**: Netlify Blobs for team codes and progress
- **New**: Supabase for hunt configuration and team data

**Issue**: Team verification still looks up codes in blob storage, but migration stored them in Supabase.

### 3. Environment Configuration ⚠️
- Cloudinary: Fully configured ✅
- Supabase: Connected and working ✅
- Netlify Blobs: Not accessible in local dev ❌

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Bridge Storage Systems
Update team verification to check Supabase instead of blob storage:
```javascript
// Current: Looks in blob storage
const mapping = await TeamStorage.getTeamCodeMapping(code)

// Needed: Look in Supabase
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('team_codes')
  .select('team_id, is_active')
  .eq('code', code)
  .single()
```

### Priority 2: Progress System Integration
Migrate progress tracking from blob storage to Supabase hunt_progress table.

### Priority 3: Blob Storage Setup
Configure Netlify Blobs for local development or migrate remaining functionality to Supabase.

## Test Coverage

| Component | Coverage | Status |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Database Schema | 100% | ✅ Passing |
| Hunt Configuration | 100% | ✅ Passing |
| Team Management | Partial | ⚠️ Mixed |
| Progress Tracking | Partial | ⚠️ Mixed |
| API Endpoints | 33% | ❌ Needs Storage |
| Authentication | 25% | ❌ Storage Issue |

## Performance Benchmarks

- **Supabase Queries**: <200ms average
- **Health Checks**: <50ms
- **Database Operations**: <300ms
- **RPC Functions**: <150ms

The test suite successfully validates the core Supabase migration and identifies the storage architecture gap that needs to be addressed for full functionality.
